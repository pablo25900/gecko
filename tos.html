        <h2>PROHIBITED USES</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract to use our Services. By using our Services, you represent and warrant that you meet these requirements. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms.</p>
        <p>You may use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms of Use. Geckoex has zero tolerance towards use of its Services for any illegal purpose.</p>
        <p>Users are cautioned against undertaking any suspicious activity on or through our services, as in the event of any suspicious transactions being undertaken, any of our partner Service Providers shall have the right but not the obligation to conduct due diligence in a way that prevents illegal activity from happening. Partners always check incoming transactions to comply with AML policies and they may sometimes require users to perform a KYC check if they believe the funds are from illegal activities. That’s why the user must know beforehand each partner’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Some partners may require KYC, some may not, and we briefly describe their practices when you simulate a trade, but in no sense that information should be taken as a fixed rule, since it is impossible to predict all situations that may arise. To know exactly what kind of verification a transaction might be subject to, consult previously the partner Service Provider’s Terms of Use that you seek to use. Geckoex will always comply by the rule of law and respect our Privacy Policy. Geckoex itself does not perform any trades, we merely provide software for both parties to interact (the user and the exchange). We don't hold nor send funds between the parties, so we can't perform these kind of checks before trades are completed, but we will always recommend and agree to our partner exchanges complying in best possible way to their respective Anti Money Laundering (AML) obligations.</p>
        <h2>INVESTMENT RISKS</h2>
        <p>Geckoex does not provide investment advice. All investments remain the responsibility of the individual.</p>
        <h2>TAX MATTERS</h2>
        <p>The users of the App are solely responsible in determining what, if any, taxes apply to their transactions. Geckoex is not responsible for determining any taxes that apply to such transactions. You agree not to hold Geckoex responsible for any issues relating to the taxation of purchases, sale, exchanges, transfers, or any other transactions related to any cryptocurrency.</p>
        <h2>CRYPTOCURRENCY TRANSACTIONS</h2>
        <p>Geckoex does not ever take custody of your funds, even for a second. Geckoex is a software that allows you to communicate with other third-party providers. By using these providers, you must understand the risks, terms, and privacy policy of these providers. Geckoex takes absolutely no responsibility for any actions taken by these third parties.</p>
        <h2>INVESTIGATION OF ABUSES</h2>
        <p>Geckoex reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of these Terms of Service, including without limitation any violation arising from any transaction you make or send to any partner. Geckoex may suspend any users whose conduct is under investigation and may prevent this user from accessing its servers as it deems appropriate and without notice. If Geckoex believes, in its sole discretion, that a violation of these Terms of Service has occurred, it may take corrective action it deems appropriate.</p>
        <h2>LAW ENFORCEMENT INQUIRIES AND SERVICE OF SUBPOENAS </h2>
        <p>If you seek information from Geckoex: Geckoex will comply with any duly issued subpoena served on us through the proper legal channels. If you are issuing your subpoena from a foreign jurisdiction, this may require you to obtain Letters Rogatory and subsequent approval from our local jurisdiction before service can be made. We do not consent to service of a subpoena by any other method. We will consider whether to respond to all other law enforcement inquiries on a case-by-case basis, and any such response is voluntary and made in our sole discretion.</p>
        <h2>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
        <p>The Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Geckoex regarding the App and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the App.</p>
