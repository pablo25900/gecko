    <h1 class="faqs-title">Frequently Asked Quesstions (FAQ's)</h1>
    <div class="faqs-all">
        <h1>Is Geckoex available in the USA?</h1>
      <p>Yes, Geckoex is optimized for USA users and supports fast, secure, non-custodial crypto swaps without registration.</p>

      <h1>Do I need an account or KYC verification?</h1>
      <p>No, Geckoex is fully anonymous and requires no accounts or KYC verification. All you need is a self-custodial wallet.</p>

      <h1>What cryptocurrencies can I swap?</h1>
      <p>You can exchange Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Monero (XMR), Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), Tron (TRX), Ripple (XRP), Tether (TRC20), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA).</p>
        <h1>Why trust us?</h1>
        <p>Our service was designed from the ground up focused on your needs. We only keep the minimum amount of logs for exchanges that require this and we let you know each one's log policies before creating the transaction. Logs kept at Geckoex are never sold or ceded to third parties and are only provided on an individual basis upon request from law enforcement.

We use minimal JavaScript to improve user experience (like in dropdown selection), but never to track or fingerprint users. It is entirely optional for most of our services, so you can block JavaScript and use our website without any problems if you want!

We only redirect your order to known and reliable instant exchanges, that receive your deposit, process the trade and transfer your funds directly to your chosen address. We do not have access to your coins at any point of the transaction.</p>
        <h1>What fees do you charge?</h1>
        <p>Typically a fixed fee of 2.2% is applied to most trades. This is made up of a 0.2% service fee and the remainder shared with liquidity providers and affiliates. If a coin has low liquidity or excessive demand an additional fee of up to 10% may apply based on network metrics.A network transaction fee is deducted from refunds.</p>
<h1>What if I do not send enough before the offer expires?</h1>
<p>Your order will be partially filled for as much as you have deposited.</p>
<h1>What if I accidentally send too much?</h1>
<p>The amount sent will be adjusted if liquidity is available. If insufficient liquidity is available then your exchange will fail and you will need to request a refund. Network fees will be deducted from the refund</p>
   <h1>What if I send funds after the offer expires?</h1>
   <p>Your exchange will be recalculated at current market rates. If too much time has passed, your offer will fail and you will need to contact support.</p>
   <h1>What if my deposit confirmation takes a long time?</h1>
   <p>Your exchange will be recalculated at current market rates if no confirmations for your deposit have been received within 30 minutes. If too much time has passed without any network confirmations, your offer will fail and you will need to contact support.</p>
   <h1>Does the cryptocurrency come from other exchanges?</h1>
   <p>No. Geckoex.app operates its own blockchain infrastructure and wallets.</p>
   <h1>Do you ever freeze transactions?</h1>
   <p>We do not accept stolen funds. May need to freeze and seize.</p>
